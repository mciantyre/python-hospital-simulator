    "# Hospital simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the hospital simulator! Follow the instructions in this file and in the comments of the Python code to complete the assignment. Follow along below, edit in this notebook, and run the cells to check your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes the conventions I'll use throughout this document. I use Python comments to call out specific sections of the code. Python comments are either prefixed with a `#` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pi = 3.14159265358979323 # That's a long number!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, they are written as a block surrounded by three `\"`s:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def word_count(list_of_words):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Returns a list of words as a dictionary. The keys are the words.\n",
    "    The values are the frequency of the word in the provided list_of_words\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above `word_count` function, the comment describes the expectation of what the `word_count` function does. Take note of these expectations. You'll see these throughout the code stubs below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "A `TODO` denotes something you need to do. Keep an eye out for them; they describe the parts you care about. I'll put `TODO`s in Python comments. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def word_count(list_of_words):\n",
    "    return dict() # TODO remove this line, and implement the word count function\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TODO` suggests that you remove that line, and provide an implementation for the `word_count` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HINT\n",
    "\n",
    "A `HINT` is something you might find helpful. They're also in Python comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def word_count(list_of_words):\n",
    "    counts = dict()\n",
    "    # HINT consider two conditions:\n",
    "    #  - the word is in the counts dictionary\n",
